        <h3>Freelancer for the marketing team of Brosway Croatia</h3>
        <p>
          Before working with Marko, we struggled with the complexities of Meta
          advertising. We felt that our campaigns weren’t delivering the results
          we needed. We weren’t reaching our target audience effectively, and
          our engagement levels were stagnant. We knew we needed help but
          weren’t sure where to turn. When we brought Marko on board as a
          freelancer , everything changed. He immediately took control of our
          Facebook and Instagram campaigns, creating a targeted strategy that
          focused on increasing engagement and brand awareness. Marko's approach
          was incredibly professional; he took the time to understand our brand,
          our goals, and our audience. The ads he designed were creative,
          effective, and tailored perfectly to resonate with our target market.
          Thanks to Marko, we saw a dramatic improvement in our ad performance.
          Our campaigns began delivering much higher conversion rates, and we
          started seeing real, tangible results. Marko continuously optimized
          the campaigns through data analysis and testing, ensuring that we were
          getting the most out of our budget. His expertise in paid social media
          advertising was evident, and his dedication to achieving results for
          us was unparalleled. Working with Marko was an absolute pleasure. He
          was always available to make adjustments or provide insights, and his
          strategic input has been invaluable in helping us grow. If you're
          looking for someone who can take your Meta ad campaigns to the next
          level, Marko is the person you need. We highly recommend him! For more

        <h3>Event Management Agency AliveNlive- London</h3>
        <p>
          Before working with Marko, we were struggling to expand our audience
          and drive ticket sales for our student events in London. Our social
          media strategy wasn’t producing the engagement we needed, and our ads
          weren’t converting. We knew we needed to revamp our approach but
          didn’t have a clear direction. When Marko came on board, everything
          changed. He immediately analyzed our current digital marketing efforts
          and identified where we could improve. His expertise really shone
          through as he restructured our social media strategy, creating highly
          targeted ad campaigns specifically for university students in the
          London area. Marko also introduced creative visuals and event-specific
          offers that grabbed the attention of our audience. Thanks to Marko’s
          strategic approach, the results were incredible. In just two weeks,
          our ticket sales increased by 400%, and our engagement on platforms
          like Instagram and Facebook skyrocketed. His retargeting strategy was
          particularly effective, bringing back potential attendees who hadn’t
          completed their purchases. Working with Marko was a game-changer for
          us, and we’re beyond thrilled with the outcome. He’s professional,
          dedicated, and has a clear talent for digital marketing. We highly
          recommend him! For more information about my work with AliveNlive,

        <h3>Project with Lorem d.o.o</h3>
        <p>
          Before working with Marko, Lorem d.o.o was facing challenges in
          establishing a strong online presence for our pharmaceutical products.
          We knew we needed to enhance our digital marketing efforts but weren’t
          sure how to effectively reach our target audience or drive sales. When
          Marko reached out to us, he presented a unique opportunity for growth.
          He proposed a tailored digital marketing strategy that included
          developing a custom-built website specifically for our product, Madal
          Bal Neera sirup. His expertise in digital marketing and website
          creation was evident as he implemented a targeted campaign that
          significantly boosted our visibility. Thanks to Marko’s efforts, we
          generated €4,000 in revenue within just four weeks. His ongoing
          support has been invaluable as he continues to manage our Meta ads and
          oversee our social media accounts. This collaboration not only
          demonstrated the potential for increased profits but also laid a
          strong foundation for our ongoing digital transformation. We’re
          excited about the many plans we have in the pipeline, and we highly
          recommend Marko for anyone looking to elevate their online presence!
